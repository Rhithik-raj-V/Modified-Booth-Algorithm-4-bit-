#  Modified Booth Algorithm â€“ 4-bit Signed Multiplier with AXI Lite Interface

This repository presents a 4-bit signed multiplier based on the **Modified Booth Algorithm (Radix-4)**, implemented in Verilog and integrated with an **AXI Lite interface** for seamless communication with a host processor. The design is compatible with both **Intel Quartus Prime** and **Xilinx Vivado 2019.2**, facilitating versatile deployment across different FPGA platforms.

##  Project Overview

- **Algorithm**: Implements the Modified Booth Algorithm (Radix-4) for efficient 4-bit signed multiplication, reducing the number of partial products and enhancing performance.
- **AXI Lite Interface**: Facilitates input and output operations via AXI Lite, allowing easy integration with embedded processors.
- **Dual Toolchain Support**: Provides project setups for both Quartus Prime and Vivado 2019.2, enabling deployment on Intel and Xilinx FPGAs respectively.

##  Features

- **Signed Multiplication**: Handles 4-bit signed operands using 2's complement representation.
- **Efficient Computation**: Utilizes Radix-4 encoding to minimize partial products, leading to faster multiplication.
- **AXI Lite Communication**: Inputs (multiplicand and multiplier) are provided via AXI Lite registers, and the result is read back through the same interface.
- **Testbenches**: Includes comprehensive testbenches to validate functionality and performance.
